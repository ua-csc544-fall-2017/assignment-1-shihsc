1. Recently, I am interested in data analysis. 
This semester I am also taking machine learning.
I would like to have more experience on dealing 
with data via different approach.

2. I think that I will learn couple method to 
deal with data via in principle and in practice.

3. C++, R.

4. C++.

5. No. 

6. The largest dataset I have had deal with is a 
net work problem. We would like to find a minimal 
length path or a minimal cost path. The tools we 
use is C++. We know some algorithms in optimal research.
We wrote them as C++ program to get answers.

7. A graph in biostatistics. It shows that which gene 
relates to canser.

8. The one we saw in the first class.

9. I do not have to many programming experience so 
I would rate myself 40%.

10. My major is math so I would rate 100%.

11. No, I have not used it before.

12. I never used Git.

13. I never used GitHub.

14. Bridge, hiking, math, jobmarket.
